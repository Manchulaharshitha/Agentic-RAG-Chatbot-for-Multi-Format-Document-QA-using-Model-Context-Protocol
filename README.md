# Agentic-RAG-Chatbot
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for multi-format document question answering, using embeddings, FAISS, and OpenAIâ€™s GPT models. Built with Streamlit for an interactive UI and structured using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to handle document ingestion, semantic search, and context-aware responses.
# ðŸ“š Agentic RAG Chatbot for Multi-Format Document QA

An AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that enables users to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and ask questions about the content. The chatbot uses embeddings, FAISS vector search, and OpenAIâ€™s GPT models to provide context-aware responses. It is built with Streamlit for an interactive user interface and structured using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

The system is composed of multiple agents working together:

1. **Ingestion Agent** â€“ Parses uploaded documents and extracts text.
2. **Retrieval Agent** â€“ Converts text into embeddings and performs similarity search.
3. **LLM Response Agent** â€“ Generates human-like answers based on retrieved content.
4. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** â€“ Orchestrates the interaction between all agents.
5. **Streamlit UI** â€“ Allows users to upload documents and ask questions easily.
